# Model Exploration

This section of code pertains to dataset creation and model exploration.

MLPModelExploration/Model_Exploration.ipynb: This file contains the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) Model code. This model takes in the 2 input channels and uses them to 
classify the event into one of 3 categories. The model is trained on the custom dataset we created and was trained multiple times in an attempt to increase the precision.
